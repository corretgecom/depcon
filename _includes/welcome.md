# What's DEPCON?

The deployment readiness condition (DEPCON) is an alert state used by IT departments to know the health of its projects based on the deployment frequency.

The DEPCON system was developed by Serveis Informàtics Corretgé.com SL with the goal of organize the deployment of Web & Client/Server applications. It prescribes six graduated levels of states of alert, dependening the frequency that a deployment is required. Usually the deployment frequency is changed because there are bugs in the production system.

Each DEPCON level has an owner in the company. A change of DEPCON level shay be approved by the level's owner. This document made recomendations, but is better to adapt it to your company structure and dimension.

Continuous Integration is a great idea but with a lot of colateral damages. With DEPCON we want to use the great CI tools restricted to delivery periods, determining the Deployment Condition by the frequency of its deployments.
