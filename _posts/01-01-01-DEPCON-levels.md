#DEPCON levels

As the military norm DEFCON has 5 levels, in DEPCON we have 6.

Everyone has a predefined frequency and a board level authorisation requirement.

Deploy an application requires resources, and is preferible to planning when we will expend these resources. To change the frequency, we shall change the DEFCON level modifying the DEPCON file in the root of the project and commit with a clear message. If the author of the commit is the responsible of the level it should be better, if not is possible, adding a By Order disclaimer is enough.
