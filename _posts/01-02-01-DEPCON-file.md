#The DEPCON file

At the root of the project we will have a DEPCON.json file where, at least, contains only the DEPCON level number:

`{"level":4}`

Could be interesting that every DEPCON change has a dedidated commit made by the DEPCON level owner and a very clear commit message.

In the future, we can review the history of the project viewing the git log of this file as:

`git log DEPCON`
