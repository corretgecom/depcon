# Best weekday

I agree totaly with [Michael King](https://twitter.com/michaelking0191) in his post "Weekly Releases: When is the Best Time to Deploy Code", Tuesday is one of the 3 Best Times to Deploy:

1. Tuesday Morning. Monday can be dedicated to fixing any high priority bugs that may have been found over the weekend, and preparing the code for deployment (merging & tagging). Developers are on hand for the rest of the day should an issue occur. The rest of the week can be dedicated completely to developing the next weekâ€™s release.
2. Wednesday Morning. Good for the same reasons as Tuesday, but unnecessarily breaks up the working week which may result in a slight drop in efficiency.
3. Thursday Morning. Exactly the same benefits and disadvantages as Wednesday, but closer to the weekend where developers are not on hand.
